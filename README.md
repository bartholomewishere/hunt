# hunt

hello.

i call this scavenger hunt

"The Hunt"

a little side project by yours truly

"The Hunt"

For thousands of years, the human survived on The Hunt

The human is not fast, not even close

Yet it runs and runs and runs

It will not stop

As it is as patient as the ones before it

Because nothing in the world hides forever, not truly

The prey runs for its life, it always did

But the hunter knows better

For The Hunt is not a sprint, but a slow burning path

A narrowing path

Where choices become few.

The hunter observes

For pattern

For meaning

Because the hunter knows that the world lets light upon those patient enough to see

The fragments are scattered

The prey are scattered

Yet the hunter presses on

The Hunt rewards those who do not break

The Hunt rewards those who move without haste

The Hunt rewards those without pause

The Hunt rewards the persistent

So therefore advance, Hunter

Trust in yourself, the Human

Step-by-step

Truth by truth

Find the reward that The Hunt promises.

Happy Hunting.
