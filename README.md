# hunt

hello.

i call this scavenger hunt

"The Hunt"

a little side project by yours truly

"The Hunt"

For thousands of years, the human survived on The Hunt

The human is not fast, not even close

Yet it runs and runs and runs

It will not stop

As it is as patient as the ones before it

Because nothing in the world hides forever, not truly

The prey runs for its life, it always did

But the hunter knows better

For The Hunt is not a sprint, but a slow burning path

A narrowing path

Where choices become few.

The hunter observes

For pattern

For meaning

Because the hunter knows that the world lets light upon those patient enough to see

The fragments are scattered

The prey are scattered

Yet the hunter presses on

The Hunt rewards those who do not break

The Hunt rewards those who move without haste

The Hunt rewards those without pause

The Hunt rewards the persistent

So therefore advance, Hunter

Trust in yourself, the Human

Step-by-step

Truth by truth

Find the reward that The Hunt promises.

Happy Hunting.

"The Watch"

For as long as the hunter breathes, The Watch endures

The day burns away, the night folds in,

Yet the eyes remain still, unblinking

For the hunter knows that the prey moves quietly

Not with thunder but with dust

Not with storms but with small forgotten shifts

The hunter waits

Waits through wind that erases tracks

Waits through sun that distorts the horizon

Waits through silence that stretches thin

Because The Watch is the counterpoint to The Hunt

A stillness sharpened into instinct

There are signs in the world

Faint scratches upon bark

A stone nudged aside

A hush where there should be wings

And the patient see these things

The world does not speak in words

But it speaks in pattern

And those who learn the language

Will hear everything

Minute by minute

Shadow by shadow

Shift by shift

The hunter gathers the world into meaning

And from meaning, direction

And from direction, truth

Endure The Watch

Let the quiet become your teacher

Let time become your ally

For only those who hold their breath longest

See what all others miss

Continue, Hunter

The path is forming beneath you

Even if you cannot yet see its shape.

"The Trail"

There comes a moment when the path reveals itself

Not in brilliance

Not in certainty

But in fragments scattered like ash across the earth

Yet the hunter knows

That a trail is never a single line

But a constellation of moments

Bound together by will

Step into the dust

The old earth remembers everything

The weight of hoof

The drag of claw

The trembling hesitation of the hunted

And though storms may blur the markings

And time may swallow the edges

Nothing is ever fully erased

Where life has passed, a trace remains

The hunter kneels

Touches the soil

Lets the silence speak

The Trail bends

It folds

It vanishes and reappears

But those who commit to each sign

Each scratch

Each disturbed leaf

Will always find their way forward

Paths are illusions

But progress is truth

So walk

Even when the earth seems empty

Even when the horizon mocks you

Even when logic fractures

Every trail is a puzzle

Every puzzle a step

Follow it, Hunter

Piece by piece

Breath by breath

The Trail leads to what you seek

If you refuse to turn back.

"The Crossing"

Beyond the trail, the land itself becomes a test

Rivers twist like old riddles

Valleys echo with false directions

Mountains reshape the wind into warnings

Yet the hunter advances

For The Crossing is where certainty ends

And resolve begins

Here, the world offers choices

And every choice narrows the way

Until the hunter must trust something deeper

Than sight

Or memory

Or past victories

Trust the movement of your own mind

The Crossing does not reward strength

But clarity

The ability to stand where paths divide

And still know which way leads forward

Storms may rise

The river may swallow its own banks

The sky may fold into dusk without warning

Yet the hunter steps through it all

Knowing that hesitation is heavier

Than any mountain

Move, Hunter

Not with speed

But with truth

Let intuition guide where maps fail

Let reasoning guide where intuition falters

Let persistence guide when all else breaks

For every great hunt requires a moment

Where the hunter becomes the compass

Cross boldly

Cross with thought

Cross with resolve

For on the far side

The path tightens

The signs sharpen

And the prize waits

Just beyond the final veil.
